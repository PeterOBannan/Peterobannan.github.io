<h1>Helping people and organizations grow with clarity and momentum.</h1>
<p class="lead">
  I work with leaders, teams, and students to make progress that lasts.  
  My approach combines hands-on teaching with practical consulting: clear systems, stronger communication, and leadership that empowers rather than overwhelms.  
  On this site you’ll find more detail about my services, work history, and ongoing projects.

<h2>About</h2>
<p class="muted">
  I’ve spent my career moving between education, healthcare, and operations — places where clarity, structure, and strong leadership matter most.  
  I grew up in Spokane, and now my family and I are based in Medical Lake. 
  My wife Tawnee and I value raising our kids with community around us — from baseball and volleyball games to our regular involvement at church. Those rhythms of family, faith, and small-town life anchor me just as much as my professional work in education and leadership.  
  This site is a place where I share both: the practical skills I bring to organizations and the personal context that shapes how I lead, teach, and serve.
