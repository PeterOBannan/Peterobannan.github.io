      <h1>Services</h1>
      <p>
        I help motivated people finish degrees faster, upskill with modern tools, and translate real-world
        experience into academic credit and leadership opportunities. My specialty is business administration
        and management (bachelor’s or master’s tracks), and I also support learners headed into healthcare,
        education, and other fields with practical “tool-building” and study systems.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Whether you’re a high-performing “bookish” learner ready to accelerate, or a builder from the trades
        with deep experience but less interest in traditional academics—I’ll meet you where you are and help
        you move quickly and confidently.
